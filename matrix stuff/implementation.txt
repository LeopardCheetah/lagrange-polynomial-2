for 0/1 points, line is trivial

for 2+ points, use interpolation to get a result (express everything as fractions so no floating point errors)

before this, the idea was to set a matrix then invert it to find solutions to the equation (this was done by hand coding-wise, w/o numpy or other modules)
now, either direct interpolation or matrix inversion is done to calc the answers
